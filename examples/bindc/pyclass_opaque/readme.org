* About
This is meant to demonstrate the implementation of a simple derived type which
is ~bind(c)~ compatible in the form of a new type. This implementation is in
theory not strongly linked to the implementation within Fortran, and might
eventually be used for regular Fortran types.

However, this is complicated enough to work in multiple stages. In order of
implementation:

0. Basic C-Python trial with ~PyCapsules~ (in ~cpython~)
1. Simple derived types (almost ~bind(c)~)
2. Derived types with type bound proceedures (in ~tb_proc~)
3. Derived types with arrays of data
4. Arrays of derived types
5. Derived types containing derived types
6. Derived types with inheritance

For each implementation, the steps are:
- Implement and test the Fortran type
- Implement and test the Fortran ISOC wrapper
- Implement and test C calling code
- Implement and test a Python module
