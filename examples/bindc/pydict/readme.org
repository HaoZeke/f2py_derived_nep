* About
This is meant to demonstrate the implementation of a simple derived type which
is ~bind(c)~ compatible in the form of a dictionary.

See [[https://rgoswami.me/posts/cython-derivedtype-f2py/#python-c-and-fortran][this post for more details]].

** Usage
#+begin_src bash
meson setup bbdir
meson compile -C bbdir
python -c "import bbdir.eucli as eucli; A=eucli.unitinc({'x':3.3,'y':5.2,'z':2.6}); print(A)"
 Modifying derived type
{'x': 4.3, 'y': 6.2, 'z': 3.6}
#+end_src
